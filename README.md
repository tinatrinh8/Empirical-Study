# Empirical-Study 🎧🥋🥣⛅️🕷️
Naïve Bayes vs Logistic Regression

## 🐨 Project Overview
This project involves a classification empirical study comparing two machine learning algorithms: Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression. 

## 🍙 Dataset
The Car Evaluation dataset is used for this study, which provides an opportunity to explore and document the performance of these algorithms in a practical setting.

[Car Evaluation Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation)

  - **Samples**: 1,728
  - **Attributes**: 6
  - **Classes**: 4 (unacceptable, acceptable, good, very good)

## 🛴 Key Components
1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Understand the Car dataset, its features, and relevance for classification tasks.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Process and encode features to prepare for model training.
3. **Model Implementation**:
   - Develop Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression models using scikit-learn.
   - Train and evaluate the models with cross-validation.
4. **Parameter Tuning**:
   - Experiment with different parameters to optimize model performance.
5. **Results Analysis**:
   - Compare model performance using metrics such as precision and recall.
   - Discuss findings and implications based on the results.
